    "Last week we saw how Python manages namespaces with the `import` statement. Without importing anything you can't do much with Python, but luckily every Python installation comes with a large __standard library__, i.e. a collection of modules importable with the `import` statement, which can help us do many useful things in our code. We saw examples of `urllib`, `pathlib` and more. Moreover, we saw that using the `pip` tool we can install a countless number of other packages which can help us do basically anything with this language. The big difference between MATLAB and Python in this sense is that external dependencies play a very (very) important role in 99% of Python projects, whilst in MATLAB you rarely depend on files from the MATLAB File Exchange. Thus we need a better system to manage those dependencies in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, issues will rise when we have multple coding projects, and perhaps multiple users, on the same computer. Each project has its own list of demands (i.e. libraries it uses) and it's very important to make sure that we don't accidently \"break\" a project, i.e. install a library with the wrong version that will serve two projects. This is why we have environments, which isolate each project with its own interpreter (which is just another library) and set of dependencies."

To make sure we're working with this specific interpreter, we have to activate the environment:\n",

Miniconda is a \"bare-bones\" installation, so it doesn't bloat your computer with unneeded packages, allowing for manual control of each package and environment.

    "OOP is the most important programming paradigm nowadays, and you should be very familiar with it. Some problems fit this paradigm hand in glove, and the best example is GUI programming. However, it's not the \"ultimate\" answer to any design difficulty you have. Some problems _can_ be solved by using intricate objects and multiple inheritance, but in reality they're much simpler when solved using procedural design. Remember to write code that humans, and especially your future self, can read and understand.\n",
